NLSExploreGeoreferencedMaps
===========================

This <a href="https://geo.nls.uk/maps/dev/explore/index.html">demonstration application</a> uses <a href="https://dev.openlayers.org/releases/OpenLayers-2.13.1/">OpenLayers 2.13</a>, a <a href="http://jqueryui.com/">JQuery UI</a> transparency slider and <a href="https://www.maptiler.com/">MapTiler</a> georeferenced mosaics to form a viewer for historical georeferenced map mosaics. Searching is possible by zooming in on the map, with an option to change the map base layer between OpenStreetMap, Bing and Google layers. Searching is also possible by using a Google gazetteer (using the Google Maps API v3), a British National Grid Reference, as well as historic county and parish drop-down lists. 


<a href="https://geo.nls.uk/maps/dev/explore/index.html">This application</a> was originally developed by <a href="https://www.klokantech.com/">Klokan Technologies GmbH</a> for the <a href="https://www.nls.uk">National Library of Scotland<a> in 2011. Following discussion in 2014, the application is now released as open-source, ON CONDITION THAT IT IS DEVELOPED WITH A DIFFERENT HISTORIC MAPS, AND NOT AS A REPLACEMENT OR ALTERNATIVE TO VIEWING THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF SCOTLAND'S MAPS. We hope that other libraries, archives and institutions may benefit from the code in making available their geographical collections.

The application accompanies the <a href="https://github.com/NationalLibraryOfScotland/NLSFindMapsByPlace">NLSFindMapsByPlace</a> Github repository and application, sharing a similar interface, use of OpenLayers, gazetteer search and css.
